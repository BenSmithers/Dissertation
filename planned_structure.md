# Structure

## Introduction

Explain motivations, what everything is. The structure of the thesis which follows. 

## Physics

The standard model, neutrinos. Three neutrino oscillations, four neutrino oscillations. 
The matter effects on neutrino oscillations. 
Cherenkov light. 
Deep inlastic scattering.
Parton distributions (maybe?)
